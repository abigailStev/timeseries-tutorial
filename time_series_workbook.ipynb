By using shorter time segments like `segment_size=32` seconds, we can use a finer `dt` like 1/64 sec on the light curves, without having so many bins for each computation that our computer grinds to a halt.

    "### 5. Dynamical power spectrum (/spectrogram): \n",
    "Instead of averaging the power spectra at each segment, save it into a dynamical power spectrum (also called a spectrogram) using `DynamicalPowerspectrum` in Stingray. Apply the normalization (see if you can re-bin it), then make a 3d plot with frequency along the y-axis, segment (which corresponds to elapsed time) along the x-axis, and power as the colormap. Don't subtract the Poisson noise before plotting here, since some segments will have noisy power below the Poisson noise level, and then you're trying to plot negative numbers on a log scale, which is a very bad idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is useful if you think the QPO turns on and off rapidly (high-frequency QPOs do this) or is changing its frequency on short timescales. If the frequency is changing, this can artificially broaden the Lorentzian-shaped peak we see in the average power spectrum. Or, sometimes it's intrinsically broad. A look at the dynamical power spectrum will tell you! This will be most interesting on the black hole J1535 data, but could be done for both objects.\n",
    "### 6. Energy bands:\n",
    "Make and plot power spectra of the same object using light curves of different energy bands. For example, try 1-2 keV, 2-4 keV, and 4-12 keV. Try to only loop through the event list once as you do the analysis for all three bands. What do you notice about the energy dependence of the signal?\n",
    "### 7. Modeling:\n",
    "Using astropy.modeling or stingray.modeling (or your own preferred modeling package), fit the power spectrum of the black hole J1535 with a Lorentzian for the QPO, a few Lorentzians for the low-frequency broadband noise, and a power law for the Poisson noise level. In papers we often report the centroid frequency and the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the QPO Lorentzian model. How would you rule out the presence of a QPO at, e.g., 12 Hz?\n",
    "### 8. Data visualization:\n",
    "Add a legend to the power spectra plot in problem 1, so that the label for the color gives the corresponding $\\zeta$.\n",
    "### 9. Poisson noise:\n",
    "Go through problem 2 and use `np.random.poisson` to apply Poisson noise to the signals (`oscill` and the four `damp`), and take the power spectra again, and plot them. Then try using the information in problem 3 about the Poisson noise level as it relates to the average count rate of the light curve to calculate and plot them together.\n",
    "### 10. Stingray phase-folded light curves:\n",
    "Looking through the Stingray documentation (and possibly HENDRICS), find a more elegant way to make phase-folded pulsar light curves."
